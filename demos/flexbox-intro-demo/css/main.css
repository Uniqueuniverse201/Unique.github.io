        The flex property can be used to specify the size that a Flexbox Item can grow to, relative to other Flexbox Items that also have the flex property set.
 
        Actually, the flex property is a shorthand property, meaning it allows you to set and configure multiple flexbox-related properties at once; however, we're going to keep our examples here relatively simple.
