                    Marvel's Spider-Man 2's gameplay trailer may have teased how Venom will be defeated in the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The symbiote was first shown off during the post-credits scene of Marvel's Spider-Man. At the end of the first game, Harry Osborn was seen inside a tank that is infused with the symbiote, with Norman promising a cure to his son. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    PlayStation's Spider-Man 2 is set to show the aftermath of that sequence and the gameplay trailer revealed that Peter Parker has already been affected by the symbiote. 
                </p>
                <h2 id="spider-man-2">Did Spider-Man 2's Trailer Reveal Venom's Weakness?</h2>
                <p>
                    During the logo section of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 gameplay trailer, electricity repels some of the symbiote when it covers the Spider-Man logo to reveal Marvel's Spider-Man 2 title. 
                </p>

                >
                <p>
                    Similarly, when the "Be greater. Together," slogan comes up at the end, electricity repels the symbiote again that wraps around the "Together" portion of the slogan. 
                </p>
                <img
                    src="images/be-greater-together.png"
                    alt="Be greater together poster"
                >
                <p>
                    Based on that tease, it's possible that electricity is the symbiote's main weakness in the game, a power that Miles Morales possesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, in Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man 3, it was established that Venom's weakness is sound.
